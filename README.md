# capstone_replication
Replication project for Quarter 1 of Capstone - AiF360 usage with MEPS data

This project consists of a replication of a project using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. We are following the guidance of our mentor throughout the course of this project and are looking to create a clear, complete, and professional deliverable. We will be exploring the MEPS dataset, dissecting fairness metrics, and applying bias mitigation techniques using the AIF360 toolkit.

# Fetching the Data
- The data files used are stored under the file name of 'data.zip'
- Unzip the file to create the folder 'data' before running any notebooks

# Running the Project
- To install the dependencies, run the following command from the root directory of the project: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Alternatively, an environments.yml file has been provided to reconstruct the specific conda environment used in our work.
